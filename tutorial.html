<h1>Minimum RISC-V System From Scratch<a class="headerlink" href="#minimum-risc-v-system-from-scratch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So, we’ll make a RISC-V system! It may sound “mission impossible” to build this
kind of thing from scratch in a relatively short time, without prior background
in hardware designs.  But it really isn’t as magical as it seems. I hope this
tutorial could serve as a tiny but inspiring guide to those programmers who
know little about hardware like I did to have a better understanding of how a
computer system works from the ground up, and for those who know a bit about
different pieces of the story but can’t put them together.</p>
<p>Nothing is better than having a playable example that is both small and
functional.  This repo already contains a RISC-V processor core implementation
that is synthesizable by itself, but also directly works with a minimal
emulator (Verilator-based) code with a realistic system setup. The processor
implements RV32I instruction set with major part of CSR Mode-M, while the
emulator emulates the cache/memory, serial console output, video output and
keyboard input. The applications are built with standard gcc/Rust RISC-V
toolchains and directly run on the processor.</p>
<p>The whole repo is simply divided into three parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Processor core implementation in Verilog: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">core.sv</span></code> (1.2K loc) and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">csr.sv</span></code> (182 loc).</p></li>
<li><p>System emulator: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sim.cpp</span></code> (423 loc).</p></li>
<li><p>Example applications that directly runs on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sim</span></code>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apps/*.c</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apps/mriscv-rs/examples/*.rs</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial is organized in two parts: the implementation of the processor
core with Verilog and the building of the final system/applications.</p>

<h3>What Makes a Processor?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-makes-a-processor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A processor, like the name suggests, <em>processes</em> data via computation. More
specifically, the prevailing modern computer processors adopt a computation
model that is largely inspired by Turing Machine (as opposed to Lambda
Calculus, which gave birth to functional programming languages). A typical
processor mainly has three main functions for its operation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The ability of taking input data from the containing system and sending
results back to it. (I/O)</p></li>
<li><p>The ability of processing the data, such as doing arithmetic or logical
operations. (Computation)</p></li>
<li><p>The ability of maintaining an internal state, which could affect its behavior
in its processing. (State and Control)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Without any one of them, the construct sounds less “exciting”: without
I/O, a processor makes no difference from a dummy blackbox that does nothing
inside; without computation, the processor can only output data as-is; without being
stateful, a processor is simply a mathematical expression whose outputs are
immediately determined by its inputs (which could be implemented solely by
<em>combinational logic</em> circuits, which will be discussed later) and the system
won’t be stateful to control other things. Many mechanical systems are
stateful, such as your wrist watch, which keeps track of the current time as
the state and keep changing it as time goes. In fact, a mechanical watch/clock <em>is</em>
a computer/processor as it takes inputs (you can adjust the time and set the alarm),
generates outputs (you can always check the time from it), process the data (basic
arithmetic to maintain the current time) and has state and control (triggers
second/minute/hour hands according to its internal state) – it is just not a
general-purpose computer by itself. However, interesting mechanical computers
do exist in history [link here].</p>
<p>Although the industry has been evolving its technology in the past decades, the
basic logic for a processor hasn’t changed that much compared to its
theoretical model: like a Turning machine takes commands from a tape that
instructs its next operation, a CPU fetches the next <em>instruction</em> from a
(logically or physically) continuous portion of memory (or from the cache). It
also changes its internal state by the instruction like Turning machine can
modify its state register. However, when it comes to details, the processor
architectures may differ in how they manage and layout their internal/external
states. Here we choose RISC-V as our target <em>Instruction Set Architecture</em>
(ISA) for our processor build. RISC-V is <em>register-based</em>, meaning all
temporary values are kept on registers in a register file, like lockers in a
locker room, indexed by names (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x0</span></code>-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x31</span></code> in RV32). They’re directly
addressable, unlike <em>stack-based</em> alternatives which usually have to push to/pop from
a stack of values for their operations.
It is also a <em>register-to-registers</em> (<em>load/store</em>) architecture, where all
operations are done on the basis of registers, so that values have to be loaded
from the memory to registers before a computation and stored back to the
memory explicitly from registers after the computation, unlike other CISC architectures like x86
which supports mixed use of values from memory and registers (a <em>register-memory</em>
architecture).</p>
<p>With these basics in mind, obviously, we need to have different parts of the
processor to take care of the three major functions. There should be a way to
<em>decode</em> the instruction into some form of internal, temporary representation of
its functionality, so as to <em>control</em> how the rest part of computation should be
carried out. There should be some logic for doing the actual calculation, some
organized internal “lockers” to hold the register values and some logic to write
the results to the memory. Finally, there should be a loop-like logic to drive
the entire composition of different parts, so the processor can move onto the next
instruction and keep its execution, like a machine gun.</p>

<div class="section" id="register-transfer-level-abstraction">
<h3>Register Transfer Level Abstraction<a class="headerlink" href="#register-transfer-level-abstraction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is not very hard to notice such a power construct could be implemented by
repeatedly applying two kinds of “logic”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the logic that is like a math expression, which calculates an “immediate”
output (response) from the given input (signal) by pure, stateless logic
operation,</p></li>
<li><p>the logic that “remembers” something, controlled by some external signal, which
could be later altered or read out. (Like a “sequencer/synthesizer”, if you’re familiar
with electronic music.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One gives us some math calculation, called <em>combinational logic</em>, while the
other one introduces the notion of states, called <em>sequential logic</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, in digital circuit design, there is a very widely used abstraction that
is based on this observation. Register Transfer Level (RTL) is used by languages
like Verilog and VHDL to create a high-level schematics of logic circuits. It
describes the logical behavior with these two kinds of logic as primitives, without having
to dive too much into the low-level (gate-level) implementation of them.
Each kind of logic usually has patterns and disciplines for its implementation
and can be automatically synthesized by specialized tools or hand-crafted if
necessary, while the RTL language can abstract this away so people can
tackle with it separately.</p>
<p>Combinational logics are usually implemented directly with
the wiring of a cascade of basic logic gates (e.g. NAND/NOR gates). For a concrete
example, a 2-input <em>multiplexer</em> (or simply “mux”) can be implemented as in the diagram:</p>
<img alt="_images/mux.svg" src="_images/mux.svg" /><p>The mux choses between inputs (I<sub>0</sub> vs. I<sub>1</sub>) for the output determined
by the control signal A. The value of I<sub>0</sub> will only be chosen when A = 1.</p>
<p>There is one thing that’s worth noting: the “calculation” here happens
“instantaneously” as the underlying logic gates “maintain” their outputs from
their inputs by physics (the use of semi-conductors). There is, however, still some
time delay due to physical properties of the gates and the time for electrons
to propagate on the wire or within the semi-conductors, at the scale of
nano-seconds. Thus, the delay is largely affected by the depth of the wiring of
gates and complexity of the overall construction.</p>
<p>Sequential logics, however, are very different. Here we only discuss about
<em>synchronous</em> sequential logic. As the main building block, a <em>flip-flop</em> not
only takes input as in combinational logic, but also requires a <em>clock</em> signal
that drives it. In sequential logic, outputs are only stabilized and deemed as
valid as the clock signal pulses (going to 0 to 1, or 1 to 0). The use of an
additional clock signal effectively introduces the notion of time into the
logic (unlike combinational logic, which is time-independent). The notion of
discrete time also makes the changing state easy to reason about and
manipulate.  Interestingly, such seemingly “magical” basic components can be
still implemented by pure wiring of gates, to be stateful. The extra clock (or
reset signal, for its asynchronous counterpart, “latches”) signal is the key
ingredient that does the trick. The schematics below shows a wiring diagram for
“D-type” flip-flop with NAND gates, which is a commonly chosen component in
synthesizing sequential logic. In this flip-flop, the output (Q) will retain
the “memorized” value, when the clock signal (Clk) is 0, and set/reset to the
input (D) when the clock is 1.</p>
<img alt="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sequential-seq6.gif" src="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sequential-seq6.gif" />
<p>Finally, consider the case where we combine both kinds of logic together: we
wire the input of a combinational logic from the output of a D-type flip-flop,
and then wire the combinational output to the flip-flop input. It creates a
“loop” which takes the output from the current state and puts the new value to
the next state after calculation, implementing an iterator whose iterations are
driven by the clock signal. Of course, the period of the clock signal (more
precisely, the minimum gap between two clock cycles) should be conservatively
chosen to be larger than the circuit time of the combinational logic, so the
input to the flip-flop is stabilized before the next clock ticks. This also reveals
why processors nowadays are “pipelined”, the topic of the next section.</p>
